# Text-to-Speech-Converter

Text-to-speech (TTS) converter is a technology that enables computers to convert written text into synthesized speech. It is designed to help individuals with visual impairments, reading difficulties, or other disabilities that make it challenging to read written text.

The TTS converter works by analyzing the text and converting it into a series of phonemes, which are the basic units of sound in a language. The phonemes are then combined to create synthesized speech, which can be played through a computer's speakers or headphones.

There are different types of TTS converters available, and they vary in terms of the quality and naturalness of the synthesized speech. Some TTS systems use pre-recorded voice samples to create speech, while others use synthetic voices that are generated by algorithms.

TTS technology has a wide range of applications, from providing voice guidance in navigation systems to creating audiobooks and podcasts. It is also used in assistive technology for people with visual impairments or reading difficulties, allowing them to access written text in a more convenient and accessible way.

Overall, TTS technology has made significant strides in recent years, with advancements in machine learning and natural language processing improving the quality and naturalness of synthesized speech. As a result, TTS has become an increasingly important tool for accessibility and communication in today's digital age.
